            We are trying to handle too many tasks and information at once. What are we actually focusing on? Even one thing is challenging, yet our fingers keep scrolling. Newsletters, social media, articles, images, videos. In a flow of endless content, we sometimes ask ourselves: does all of this actually matter?
          </p>
          <p>
            The One Thing reminds us that truly important things are few, and only by focusing on one thing can meaningful results occur. Whether in work, study, or life choices, focusing on one action can trigger a domino effect that resolves many others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reality is different. We take on everything we can, juggle multiple projects, and push ourselves beyond our limits. "I can do it" becomes a habitual refrain. But in doing so, time and energy are spread thin, and multitasking becomes an illusion where nothing is fully accomplished.
          </p>
          <p class="mid">
            The fragments of stories delivered through infinite scrolling provide us with excessive information. We scroll for new stimuli and consume content almost mechanically. Our thinking gets fragmented, and deep thought diminishes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neuroscientist Earl Miller explains that the human brain can consciously process only 1–2 things at a time. Multitasking increases switch costs and lowers IQ. Amid the bombardment of fragmented information, we become fatigued and lose our capacity for focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Social media algorithms are designed to keep us engaged. Outrageous news, controversial comments, provocative images—these erode the brain's ability to concentrate and cloud our choices. More information does not equal productivity. Focus is not merely a matter of will; it is a matter of environment and structure.
          </p>
          <p class="hard">
            We cannot endure boredom. Time alone, doing nothing, is uncomfortable. In studies at Virginia and Harvard, participants could not endure 6–15 minutes in an empty room and pressed an electric shock button. We constantly seek new stimuli to escape this boredom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, without this breathing room, creativity, self-reflection, goal-setting, and empathy all diminish. Boredom is a minimal condition for growth. But in the digital rush, we cannot withstand it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, focus and thought do not arise naturally from the flow of information. They stem from choices, structures, and the ability to endure time. We are reading countless things now, but what is truly absorbed is diminishing.
